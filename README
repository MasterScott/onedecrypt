WebEx One-Click Registry Key Decryptor

-------------------------------------------------

The WebEx One-Click client stores user passwords 
encrypted within the registry however the encryption
is really not all that amazing. 

It takes the values of these registry keys:

    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\WebEx\ProdTools\UserName
    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\WebEx\ProdTools\SiteName

Combines and repeats them out to 32 bytes. For instance
    UserName key = braanton
    SiteName key = siteaa.webex.com/siteaa

So the encryption key would be:

    braantonsiteaa.webex.com/siteaab

Next it takes uses the following IV to make things "secure":
    123456789abcdef03456789abcdef012

webex-onedecrypt.c is a PoC to decrypt the values stored in the 
registry. Just manually set the regVal, regLength and key variables. 

To compile:
    gcc -o webex-onedecrypt -lssl webex-onedecrypt.c

then make a metasploit harvaster module..

Enjoy!
